# Predictive Modeling

#### Projects developed in this repository are examples of Predictive Modeling:
- [predictive_analytics - r_squared_evaluation](https://github.com/manuelmusngi/predictive_modeling/blob/master/predictive_analytics%20-%20r_squared_evaluation.ipynb)
- [predictive_modeling-evaluation-metrics](https://github.com/manuelmusngi/predictive_modeling/blob/master/predictive_modeling-evaluation-metrics.ipynb)
- [predictive_modeling-regression](https://github.com/manuelmusngi/predictive_modeling/blob/master/predictive_modeling-regression.ipynb)

Predictive modeling uses statistics to predict outcomes. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modeling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. Predictive modeling statistical techniques include data modeling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining. Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modeling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of machine learning, as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modeling is often referred to as predictive analytics.

The core of predictive modeling relies on capturing relationships between explanatory variables and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy and usability of results will depend greatly on the level of data analysis and the quality of assumptions.

Companies use predictive modeling to forecast events, customer behavior, as well as financial, economic, and market risks.
